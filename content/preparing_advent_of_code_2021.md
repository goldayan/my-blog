I tried advent of code in following years but i am able to complete Day 4
problems in 2019 and Day 7 in 2020 only. This year my goal is to complete all 25 Day
challenges and try to solve it using TDD(Test Driven Development) style.

## TDD style
- Write test
- Write Code
- If Test fails, Refactor the code
- Repeat till you get final solution

### More on TDD
- Book: Test Driven Development By Example - Kent Beck.
- https://kentbeck.github.io/TestDesiderata/

## Preparation the environment
- Pick your programming language
  - Me: Swift.
- Start solving problems.
- Automate directory structure creation. (optional)

### Automate Directory Creation 
- Create project structure for each day.
- This save me few mintues.
```sh

#!/bin/sh

echo "Which Day challenger ?"
read DAY

DIRPATH="Day $DAY"
mkdir "$DIRPATH"
cd "$DIRPATH"

swift package init

# I prefare library if you prepare executable file use below command
#swift package init --type=executable

# If you prefare solving in XCode, uncomment next line.
# swift package generate-xcodeproj

```

Let see how it goes.

If you like to get along and start solving challenges, you are all welcome. If
you manage to complete all challenge. I wil present you a small prize (First Come First Serve)
