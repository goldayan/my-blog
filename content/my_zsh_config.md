Apple changed the default shell to zsh from bash for quite sometime. let's
customize it.People often use [OH MY ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/), I used it for a year but it seems bloated to
me. Below is my simple and effective configuration.

<!-- more -->

## Changing the shell prompt to **Starship**
- Default prompt is ugly
- Startship is the best i used.[period]
- Install starship from https://starship.rs/
- Startship toml file config (~/.config/starship.toml)
```toml
add_newline = false

[character]
success_symbol = "[‚ûú](bold green)"

# Clear visibility for exit codes
[status]
style = "bg:red"
symbol = "üí£ "
format = '[\[$symbol$status\]]($style) '
disabled = false

# These symbols will only show when battery levels are 20% or less
[battery]
charging_symbol = "‚ö°Ô∏è "
discharging_symbol = "üíÄ "

[[battery.display]]  # "bold red" style when capacity is between 0% and 20%
threshold = 40 
style = "bold red"

#[python]
#python_binary = "python3"

[swift]
symbol = "ÔØ£ (orange)"
```
- I have added a warning when my battery is below 40 to warn me and swift language symbol.
- Add the following line in .zshrc to start starship when shell initialize.
```sh
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

## Key Bindings Changes
- Edit Command in nvim (choose the editor you like)
```sh
export EDITOR=nvim
```
- Bind edit command line command to Ctrl+x plus Ctrl+e [Work in Progress]
```sh
bindkey '^X^e' edit-command-line
```
- Once we set editor as vim, zsh changes bindings to vi, override with emacs bindings
```sh
bindkey -e
```
- Check all the key bindings 
```sh
bindkey | less
```

## ZSH autosuggestion
- I like to see suggestion(taken from previous bash history) when typing, ZSH Autosuggestion does that.
- Now i can't work without it.
```sh
source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```

## Z Script Integration
- Easily jump between directories easily.
- src: https://github.com/rupa/z/
- I have copied the `z.sh` from the above github and place it `/Users/sample/Scripts/Production/z.sh`
- Adding it to the .zshrc
```sh
. /Users/sample/Scripts/Production/z.sh
```

## History override
- Override history threshold.
```sh
HIST_STAMPS="dd.mm.yyyy"
HISTFILE=~/.histfile
HISTSIZE=100000
SAVEHIST=100000
```
## FZF Integration
- FZF integration with shell.
- I favourite is `ctrl+r`, search through history with FZF.
```sh
[ -f ~/.fzf.zsh ] && source ~/.fzf.zsh
```

## NeoVim as Manpager [Optional]
- Using neovim as Man page viewer (Why not? :p)
```sh
export MANPAGER="nvim -c 'set ft=man' -"
```

## Alias
- Created alias to edit and source Zshell config
- Customize to your likings.
```sh
alias zshcnf="nvim ~/.zshrc"
alias zshsrc="source ~/.zshrc"
```
